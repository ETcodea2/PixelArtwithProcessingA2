# PixelArtwithProcessingA2
Pixel Art characters made with processing using Python for the CODE A2 project 

Introduction - the project's aim
The Pixel Art Characters Project aims to create pixel art characters using Python within the Processing application. This project holds nostalgic significance, reflecting the early gaming experiences that influenced my childhood. By translating visual concepts into code, I navigated coding challenges on a 40x40 grid, enhancing my understanding of creative coding.

Technologies
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Framework/Application: Processing
	•	Resources: YouTube tutorials, official Processing and Python documentation

Launch
• Download and install the Processing. Copy and Paste code, then run. 

Scope of functionalities 
	•	Creation of a 40x40 pixel grid where each pixel is represented as a 10x10 rectangle.
	•	Utilise the setup() function to initialise the canvas and set dimensions.
	•	Use the draw() function to render graphics in real-time continuously.
	•	Ability to fill specific pixels with colour using the fill() function.
